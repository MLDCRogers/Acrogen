restrict input to alphab?
better: restrict input strings to chars in dict_file
if given just one arg, use that as list of first-chars?
notify if no words found - don't just give blank output?
make dictionary words lowercase too
write proper debug messages
modularise file reading by creating specific function
check licensing of Zed's debug macros
error on line realloc causes memory errors
memerrors are caused by goto error: fclose, free, etc are called twice
